Pangbox Server is not, at this time, capable of providing a complete PangYa experience, or in fact much of the PangYa experience at all, in its current state. It is provided AS IS as a proof-of-concept that I hope will be useful to the community, and I hope that the groundwork laid will enable us to make a robust set of server implementations for PangYa.
